First, Read from the initial cost and machine files so they are stored.

Then create 2 threads will run the same time as the main function.

In the main function, the user will provide input that allows the cost
matrix to be updated. This updated cost matrix will be sent to other
machines.

One thread, receiveInfo, will periodically look for changes to the cost
table and make sure the changes are storedin the cost matrix.

Another thread, linkState, will periodically run the Link State
Algorithm and find the least cost paths to each node. The implementation
will use Djikstra's algorithm.
